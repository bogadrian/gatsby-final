# I built My blog with GatsbyJs

I just finished building my blog with GatsbyJs. This blog!

GatsbyJs is a framework built on top of React. But unlike React, with Gatsby we can “serve” static files! Which makes Gatsby not good to build CRUD apps.

Instead, it is perfect for building blogs and static sites.

Sites that don’t need to be updated so often and especially not updated by the users out there!

In GatsbyJs you load the files in front-end, in markdown format and the framework takes care to display them in a very proper way, querying the ".md" file store and images with GraphQl!

So, for someone like me very used to Wordpress, what changes Gatsbtjs brings?

First of all, let me say that GatsbyJs is a super optimized framework for static content delivery!
No back-end data fetch like in Wordpress, no bugs in asynchronous Javascript that make the site load so hard sometimes!

And, the most important: images super optimized!

Yes, Gatsby takes care of the images and deliver them in a way that enhances a lot the User Experience!

The image loads lazy and there is not that annoying effect of the page bumping up once the image has loaded.

We don’t need to do anything in order to render images responsive. GatsbyJs does all of that for us!

# So, what I learned from building my blog with GatsbyJs?

Well, I polished my React skills first of all.

You can take a look at the site code <a href="https://github.com/bogadrian/gatsby-final" target="_blank"># GIT</a> repository and see how many components I built! Some are querying the data directly withGraphQl, others are being passed the data by props.

I segmented the site in small components in order to make them as reusable as possible.
Then I polished out my CSS skills. Skills that really need to be improved.

Well, as you may see, the overall aspect of the site isn’t the most beautiful user interface you have might ever see!
Nevertheless, I think I did pretty good work anyway, compare to my CSS skills.

Styling the site with SASS was the hardest part for me. It was not so hard to query data from the markdown files and images files with GraphQl, as it was to style the site!

Now I am one step closer to CSS and a lot closer to React!
