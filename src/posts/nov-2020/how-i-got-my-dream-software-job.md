#My story is kind of unbelievable to myself.

Not because of my age, making it into the industry, but because the way I did it.

#Let me tell you which is my background!

I worked all my life in the transportation filed.

I was mostly, simply, a lorry and a bus driver!

I had some periods when I used to work in a transport company office as logistics coordinator, taking care of calling every day the drivers and the clients.

Exhausting work, not very rewarding I must say.

I had my own truck company for a short while but things didn’t go well.

Transportation is such a low-level occupation, and I don’t say It offending but because in the transportation field the education and gentleness between people is some kind of lacking.

It is a jungle to be honest!

The interest for tech was however strong with me since forever.

I always knew how to fix computers and hardware somehow.

I also used WordPress and had a blog from the early days of WordPress when its installation had to be done manually.

But I have never dug into code until 3 years ago!

I don’t know why I was thinking that: coding is not for me.

#Too complicated!

But 3 years ago, I discovered JavaScript.

I got into it by case. I was learning digital marketing.

I wasn’t very good at it to be honest.

To the human part of it.

Selling, staying face to face (screen to screen), to clients etc.

But I was good to the technical part of it.

And by that, I mean to the analytics and traking.

For traking user interactions in websites, a web marketer uses Google Tag Manger nowadays in order to integrate the Analytics or third-party JavaScript snippets.

I learned GTM and I know it quite well.

But sometime I got frustrated because it uses JavaScript under the hood to grab data from websites.

So, I found myself searching for how JavaScript is implemented in GTM.

#All that comes after, is just story.

I started to learn more and more JavaScript.

Then I forgot about the digital marketing and I drowned myself into only learning to code.

#Now, about 3 years later I got my dream job as a software developer.

I am not saying software engineer, because I never finished an university.

I can’t call myself an engineer, it just sounds unfair to me and to people who did finished university.

#So, Adrian, what is so special about your journey to your dream job?

Well, if telling you that coming from driving a camion to work as a software developer at 46-year-old isn’t enough, let me continue!

I receive lots of messages form people asking how I did it, how did I learned and more, how did I find a job?

By the way: the job I found is much more than I could ever dream of!

A part from the economical point of view, I must tell you that, the working environment, the people I found here and the fact the team is at the beginning of its composition are something I never been used to in the transportation.

It is another world, like I went from the Earth to the Moon.

#Here comes my answer to who asked me about how I did it!

Let me ask you something first:

Let’s suppose you are a show manager and you want to invite Michel Jackson (R.I.P), at your show!

I call you and I tell you I am Michel Jackson and I am willing to come over!

What do you do? Do you believe me? Will you give the job to me?

Let’s suppose I pack everything you are asking for in a very nice box and I am sending it to you!

I am telling you I am even better then Michel Jackson and you will never regret if you call me into your show!

Again: What do you do? Do you give me the job?

I suppose not!

If I were you, I won’t believe you, neither you are Michel Jackson, neither you are better than him!

And I don’t want to take any chances with you!

You can’t blame me for that!

#So, how can I make it into your show?

First thing first: I must really want to make it into your show!

With all my willing powers!

Then, I am not sending that box to you (read CV).

That box will end up in middle of other hundreds, even thousands similar boxes.

Which makes it a lottery!

I won once at the lottery when I was young. A pretty high amount of money for me those times back!

But the luck can’t repeat itself at the infinite, can it?

Instead what I would do, is that, I will take any action possible to render possible that YOU MAY SEE ME in the mix!

#Well, is what I exactly did!

Since I start learning to code, I did something not too many do: I learned in public!

Every bit of knowledge I grasped I published it on LinkedIn!

Yes man, LinkedIn made my luck!

I used LinkedIn conscientiously to promote myself and my learning path!

#I did marketing for myself, incessantly!

Many times I was wrong and the bits of code I was sharing or the solutions to some coding issue weren’t right!

People came and corrected me!

Besides learning more in this way, I used LinkedIn like a personal agenda to keep track of my progresses!

But that was in public, under the eyes of everyone rather in some hidden file on my computer!

Because if you think you can replace Michel Jackson on the stage, that show manager must see you somewhere.

It must be him asking about you, not the other way around!

#How can he possibly know that you exist if you stay hidden?

You think that sending him that nicely packed box with what you know or can do is enough?

No, it is not!

I don’t know if I applied to 5 jobs in all these 3 years!

When I did it was for experimenting not because I believed it can happen - to be offered a job!

I was instead contacted more times than that by recruiters on LinkedIn.

#Then I understood LinkedIn was my tool, my stage!

There and only there I can show me of!

Where else?

Where the show's managers hanging around can see me if not in LinkedIn?

Of course, I didn’t conclude anything because the “planets must align themselves” as a LinkedIn friend of mine said.

But if you have faith, that will happen sooner or later!

#It happened to me!

And to close this let me tell you a joke:

Peter was praying God every day to give him a chance to win at the lottery.

"Please God, help me win, please! If you help me win, I will keep just a little indispensable amount for me and the rest of it I will devolve to the poors! Please!"

Every day Peter said that pray for years!

Until God got tired of Peter, talk to him:

"Peter for God sake, I will let you win, but play at the lottery at least once!”.

PS: I really learned a lot in these 3 years and I will keep on learning even much more now that I am in!

I didn’t fake mine “Michel Jackson”.

Don’t try to fake yours!
