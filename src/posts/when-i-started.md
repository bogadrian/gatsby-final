From a new web developer! My name is Bogdan Adrian and, as many others out there, I am a self-taught developer.

But I am not as many others out there. I am like a few of them, maybe nobody in the end!

Not because I’m special or because I am so great at writing code, which I am not; rather I am a modest and not very sociable person.

I am like a few developers out there because of my age and my background!

I am 45 years old. And I started to learn to code only at this age! More, I used to be a European truck driver! No background in the tech industry!

Well, except for my passion which led me to build websites in WordPress since forever, if I can remember. And a couple of years learning digital marketing.

But no coding skills. Maybe just a little about CSS and Html, just to modify little things on those sites build in WordPress.

I always felt a very natural attraction towards tech, but never dared to try coding till now at 45 years old.

I started to code, being very motivated and determinate. And it is still that way. But I couldn’t know if I can do it. It could be too hard for me, not because of my age, but because coding is hard generally speaking.

Well, let me tell you that: I almost done it so far!

I can write code in JavaScript now. I have created a couple of apps on my own, without any help or tutorials. More will come in the way as I move forward.

By the time I write this, my next move is to get into Node.js and then React.

As I was learning JavaScript, I used to be exposed to Node.js quite a bit. So, I already know something about it. But I need to take myself to the next level and learn it well.

What I mean by “well”, it is not to become a senior developer by self-teaching. I know that won’t be possible without a lot of experience in an environment suitable.

Just to be able to write a full-stack application. I already know how to do that using Firebase, but I want to be able to write all server-side code by myself.

Like a to-do app, for example, which relies on server-side and not on the Local Storage as I’ve done so far.

And maybe, to create the app that I have in mind. An app for Europeans lorry drivers to help them find parking for their tracks. An app that will take advantage of the Google Maps API and which architecture I already designed in my mind.

I know I need to learn React to build such an app. It will run mostly on mobile. Only with Bootstrap and Vanilla JavaScript, which I already know, is not going to be enough.

Well, to be honest, I still have a lot of work to do with myself with JavaScript algorithms. I still need to learn how to modify every kind of data properly and cleanly using algorithms and prototypal data structure methods.

But I am on a good path, I am learning every day for hours and if I look behind where I was when I first started, it seems to me like there was another me, more naive than my actual me.

Ok, so I know you are going to ask:

Why? Why are you learning all of this at your age? Does it even make sense? Do you think you still have time to become good at it?

"It is not too late for you?".

There are online a lot of questions like this. Made by people in my position. People who try to learn to code to change their lives, their careers, at an age not very suitable to do that.

Meanwhile, the answers are almost always positive, I have to recognize that, it is not easy to get to be convinced and keep focused on learning.

Well, I can tell you that: I am learning to code for myself. Because I enjoy it because I want to.

I am not thinking of getting a job or changing my life with that. I know very well that can hardly change.

Very many people are learning to code this day. And the challenge to get a job is tougher and tougher. I may not be able to win that challenge, I’m just aware of it.

"So, then why are you spending all your time learning something which you know may not be useful in your life?".

Because my brain needs that!

I need to know! I need to understand why things are working the way they are.

There cannot exist closures without me understanding them. What is the sense of the prototypal inheritance if I don’t know what it is about? What are the promises for if I don’t know how to use them?

Why classes? What are they good at? I learned a lot about classes and instantiation before I had an “ah-ah!” And I saw where and why we use classes in JavaScript. Why they are called syntactic sugar.

I learned about patterns without understanding the real use of them, that till I took Colt Steel course about Webpack!

Can you see the wonderfulness of all of this?

That’s why I am learning! Because I love it!

If one day someone will give me a job, that will be just a bonus for what I learned. Till then, I will keep on driving that lorry (now is a bus), and learning in my free time! All my free time!

My wife thinks I got crazy, and she hates my computer already. How can she possibly understand how beautiful writing code is?

For me is not a big deal anyway!

If I was not learning, what else I could do? Watching football on TV? Netflix? Going out for a beer? Talking about crappy politics on Facebook with people I don’t know?

I already have done that all my life! So, now is the right time to spend my free days doing something I love, is it?

And if I won’t be able to get that full knowledge to let me earn a new life, I will take away with me the awareness that I am a developer!

And sorry if that seems to be too little for you, it is not for me!
