The :active pseudo-class is commonly used on <a> and <button> elements. Other common targets of this pseudo-class include elements that contain an activated element, and form elements that are being activated through their associated <label>.

Styles defined by the :active pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class (:link, :hover, or :visited) that has at least equal specificity. To style links appropriately, put the :active rule after all other link-related rules, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active.
