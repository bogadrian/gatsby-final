#I Build My blog with GatsbyJs

I just finished to build my blog with GatsbyJs. This blog!
GatsbyJs is a framework built on top of React. But unlike React, with Gatsby we can “serve” static files! Which makes it not good to build CRUD apps but perfect for building blogs and static sites.

Sites that don’t need to be updated so often and especially not updated by the users there out!

In GatsbyJs you load the files in front-end too, in markdown format and the framework takes care to display them in a very proper way!

So, for someone like me, very used to Wordpress, what changes Gatsbtjs brings?
First of all, let me say that GatsbyJs is super optimized for content delivery!
No back-end data fetch like in Wordpress, no bugs in code that make site load so hard sometimes!

And, most important: images super optimized!

Yes, Gatsby takes care of the images and deliver them in a way that enhance a lot the User Experience!

The image lazy loads and there is not that annoying effect of the page bumping up once the image has loaded.

We don’t need to do anything for the images to render them responsive. GatsbyJs does all for us!

#So, what I’ve learned from building my blog with GatsbyJs?

Well, I polished my React skills first of all. You can take a look at the site Git repository and see how many components I built!

I segmented the site in small components in order to make them as reusable as possible.
Then I polished out my CSS skills, which really need to be improved.

Well, as you may see, the overall aspect of the site isn’t the most beautiful user interface you have might ever see! Nevertheless, I think I did a pretty good work anyway, compare to my CSS skills.

But styling the site was the hardest part for me. It was not so hard to fetch data from the markdown files and images files with GraphQl as it was to style the site!

Now I am stepping closer to CSS and a lot closer to React!
