              My name is Adrian. I am a full-stack web developer. I started to
              learn web development at the end of 2017. Before that I only used
              Wordpress to build websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              I knew how to build static sites with Wordpress since 2007. Since
              Wordpress had to be installed manually. I always believed that
              Wordpress is enough for my needs. It allows everybody to build
              wonderful sites. But one day I had to do more than Wordpress
              allowed me to do. I had to choose between learning PHP and build
              my own plugin for Wordpress, or learn Javascript in order to build
              web interactiv apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I start to learn JavaScript and never stopped ever since. My
              programming language is JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              My stack is NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDb, ReactJs, React Native. The
              MERN stack, as it is usually named. I am self-taught developer. I
              learned mostly from Udemy in the beginning. When I felt pretty
              comfortable with understanding documentation, I went trough
              ExpressJs, Mongoose, ReactJs documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am now able to build any kind of full-stack web application. Of
              course, more complicate this is, the more time I need to put it
              together.
            </p>
            <p>
              I canâ€™t believe what a long way I came since 2017. And there is a
              lot in front of me yet to come.
